# **12.1.2 Fencing and Physical Barriers**

Fences and barricades are **the first physical security layer**. Their role is to deter, delay, and control movement around a facility.

Key points:

- High-security sites often add **top guards** (barbed wire, razor wire, concertina wire) to prevent climbing.
    
- Attackers may still bypass top guards using objects like blankets or mattresses.
    
- Local laws may limit which fencing materials or heights can be used.
    
- Fences require **regular inspection and maintenance** (soil erosion, animal burrows, damage).
    
- Vehicles must **not be parked near fences**, as they can help intruders climb or break the barrier.

# **12.1.3 Biometrics**

Biometrics use unique human characteristics for authentication.

Common biometric types:

- Face
    
- Fingerprint
    
- Hand geometry
    
- Iris
    
- Retina
    
- Voice
    
- Signature dynamics
    

Biometric systems offer strong identity verification and are widely used in phones, payments, and secure facilities.

**Selection factors:**

- Accuracy
    
- Speed/throughput
    
- User acceptability
    
- Resistance to spoofing
    
- Reliability
    
- Data storage needs
    
- Enrollment time
    
- Intrusiveness
    

**Error Types:**

- **Type I (False Rejection):** legitimate user is denied.
    
    - Not critical in access control, but harmful in customer services (banking, retail).
        
- **Type II (False Acceptance):** an unauthorized person is accepted.
    
    - The most serious error — represents a security breach.
        

**Acceptance Rate:**  
Percentage of imposters incorrectly accepted (Type II error rate).

# **12.1.5 Surveillance**

Surveillance strengthens physical security by **deterring intruders** and helping security staff **detect and respond** to suspicious activity.

Typical systems organizations consider:

- CCTV cameras
    
- Motion sensors
    
- Door sensors
    
- Alarm systems
    
- Monitoring at reception / security desks
    

Surveillance supports access control by ensuring that staff can intervene during an intrusion or suspicious event.
