# **2.2 — Threats, Vulnerabilities, Risk & Threat Actors**

## **2.2.1 — Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk**

### **Key Terms**

- **Threat**  
    A potential danger to an asset (data, network, devices).
    
- **Vulnerability**  
    A weakness in a system, design, or configuration that a threat can exploit.
    
- **Attack Surface**  
    The total set of vulnerabilities exposed to an attacker.  
    Example: OS + browser both unpatched = larger attack surface.
    
- **Exploit**  
    A mechanism used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
    
    - **Remote exploit** → attacker needs no prior access.
        
    - **Local exploit** → attacker already has user/admin access.
        
- **Risk**  
    The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause damage.

### **Risk Management Methods**

1. **Risk Acceptance**
    
    - Cost of protection is higher than the risk → do nothing.
        
2. **Risk Avoidance**
    
    - Eliminate the activity/device that causes the risk.
        
3. **Risk Mitigation**
    
    - Reduce exposure or impact.
        
    - Most common method.
        
4. **Risk Transfer**
    
    - Shift risk to a third party (ex: insurance).
        

---

### **Other Terms**

- **Countermeasure** → Action taken to protect assets and reduce risk.
    
- **Impact** → Amount of damage if a threat succeeds.

## **2.2.2 — Hacker vs. Threat Actor**

### **Meaning of “Hacker”**

A hacker can be:

- A skilled programmer
    
- A security professional
    
- Someone trying to access devices illegally
    
- Someone running tools to damage networks
    

### **Hacker Categories**

- **White Hat**  
    Ethical hackers → do penetration testing → report vulnerabilities → often rewarded.
    
- **Grey Hat**  
    Not fully malicious; may break into systems without permission but not for profit.  
    Often report issues after compromising a system.
    
- **Black Hat**  
    Criminals motivated by money, revenge, or destruction.  
    Exploit systems illegally to cause harm or steal data.
    

### **In This Course**

The term **threat actor** refers mainly to **grey hat** and **black hat** hackers.

## **2.2.3 — Evolution of Threat Actors**

### **Early History**

- **1960s: Phreaking (Phone Freaking)**  
    Using tones/whistles to manipulate telephone switches for free calls.
    
- **1980s: War Dialing**  
    Programs dialed phone numbers to find modems → used password crackers.
    

### **Modern Threat Actor Types**

- **Script Kiddies**  
    Inexperienced users running existing tools for fun or disruption.
    
- **Vulnerability Brokers**  
    Grey hats who find exploits and sell/report them (sometimes for rewards).
    
- **Hacktivists**  
    Grey hats motivated by political or social causes.  
    Use leaks, DDoS, website defacement, etc.
    
- **Cybercriminals**  
    Black hats stealing money or data; often part of organized crime.
    
- **State-Sponsored Hackers**  
    Work for governments; focus on espionage, sabotage, and intelligence gathering.

## **2.2.4 — Cybercriminals**

- Motivated by money; may act alone or in organized groups.
    
- Buy/sell exploits, tools, stolen data, and intellectual property.
    
- Target individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises.

## **2.2.5 — Cybersecurity Tasks**

Cybersecurity is a **shared responsibility**.

### **Users should:**

- Report suspicious activity
    
- Be careful with email/web content
    
- Protect personal and work information
    

### **Organizations must implement:**

- Trusted IT vendors
    
- Up-to-date security software
    
- Regular penetration testing
    
- Strong password policies + 2FA
    
- Regular Wi-Fi password changes
    
- Backups (cloud + local)
    
- Updated security policies

## **2.2.6 — Cyber Threat Indicators**

### **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**

Evidence that an attack _has already occurred_.  
Examples:

- Malware file hashes
    
- Malicious IP addresses/domains
    
- Suspicious filenames
    
- System changes
    

IOCs help analysts understand what happened and how to respond.

### **Indicators of Attack (IOA)**

Focus on **attacker behavior and strategy**, not damage.  
IOAs help build **proactive defense** because attack techniques repeat across different scenarios.

## **2.2.7 — Threat Sharing & Cybersecurity Awareness**

### **CISA (USA)**

- Promotes cybersecurity awareness.
    
- Runs **AIS (Automated Indicator Sharing)** → instant sharing of threat indicators between government and private sector.
    

### **NCASM (National Cybersecurity Awareness Month)**

Promotes:

- Social media safety
    
- Privacy settings
    
- App security awareness
    
- Software updates
    
- Safe shopping
    
- Wi-Fi safety
    
- Protecting customer data
    

### **ENISA (Europe)**

EU equivalent of CISA → provides cybersecurity guidance and best practices.
