# **2.1 – Network Security Overview**

## **2.1.2 — Networks Are Targets**

- Modern networks are attacked constantly.
    
- News reports frequently mention attacks, data theft, or major breaches.
    
- Tools like **Kaspersky Cyberthreat Real-Time Map** show ongoing global attacks in real time.
    
- Many similar cyberthreat maps exist online.

## **2.1.3 — Reasons for Network Security**

Network security is essential for business continuity.  
A breach can cause:

- Loss of revenue
    
- Loss of business data
    
- Compromised privacy and integrity
    
- Legal consequences
    
- Threats to public safety
    
- Damage to corporate reputation
    

Security professionals must stay aware of evolving threats.  
Useful tools:

- **Cisco Talos Intelligence** → global threat intelligence
    
- **Cisco PSIRT** → investigates vulnerabilities in Cisco products and publishes advisories

## **2.1.4 — Vectors of Network Attacks**

### **Attack Vector**

A path used by a threat actor to access a system, server, or network.

### **External Threats**

- Originates from the internet
    
- Example: **DoS attack** saturating device/resources and preventing legitimate access

### **Internal Threats**

Can be accidental or intentional:

- Stealing or copying confidential data
    
- Misconfiguring or damaging internal systems
    
- Unplugging critical network links
    
- Plugging infected USB drives
    

**Internal threats are often more dangerous** because insiders have:

- Direct physical access
    
- Knowledge of systems
    
- Access to sensitive data
    

Security teams must defend against _both_ external and internal attacks.

## **2.1.5 — Data Loss**

Data is one of an organization’s most valuable assets (financial, HR, customer, R&D, etc.).

### **Data Loss / Data Exfiltration**

Occurs when data is leaked, stolen, or unintentionally exposed.

### **Consequences**

- Damage to reputation
    
- Loss of competitive advantage
    
- Loss of customers & revenue
    
- Legal action & fines
    
- High cost for recovery and notification
    

### **Common Data Loss Vectors**

#### **1. Email & Instant Messaging**

- Intercepted emails/IMs may expose sensitive information.
    

#### **2. Lost or Stolen Devices**

- A stolen laptop containing unencrypted data = immediate breach.
    

#### **3. Cloud Storage**

- Misconfigured cloud accounts can leak sensitive data.
    

#### **4. USB Drives**

- Unauthorized copying onto USB
    
- Lost USB devices containing confidential data
    

#### **5. Improper Disposal**

- Paper documents not shredded can reveal confidential information.
    

#### **6. Password Weakness**

- Weak or stolen passwords give attackers direct access.
