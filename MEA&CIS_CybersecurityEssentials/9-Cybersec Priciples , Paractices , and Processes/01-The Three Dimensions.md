# **10.1.2 The Cybersecurity Cube – Summary**

The **Cybersecurity Cube** is a model that describes the full scope of what it means to protect data.  
It has **three dimensions**, each representing a key aspect of cybersecurity.

---

## **1. Security Principles (CIA Triad)** — _Dimension 1_

These are the core goals of cybersecurity:

- **Confidentiality**  
    Prevent unauthorized access to information.
    
- **Integrity**  
    Ensure data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy.
    
- **Availability**  
    Ensure authorized users can access data and systems when needed.
    

➡️ Together, these form the **CIA Triad**.

---

## **2. Data States** — _Dimension 2_

Data exists in three possible states, and **all must be protected**:

- **Data in transit** — moving across networks
    
- **Data at rest** — stored on disks, drives, backups
    
- **Data in process** — actively being used or modified
    

Cybersecurity must secure **every state**, not just stored data.

---

## **3. Safeguards** — _Dimension 3_

Security controls fall into three categories:

- **People**  
    Education, training, awareness, good practices
    
- **Technology**  
    Tools, hardware, software, cybersecurity technologies
    
- **Policy and Practices**  
    Security policies, rules, procedures, governance
    

➡️ Effective defense requires all three working together.

---

# **10.1.3 CIA Triad – Confidentiality**

Confidentiality ensures that **only authorized users** can access information.  
Two important techniques help enforce confidentiality:

---

## **1. Tokenization**

- Replaces sensitive data with a **random token**
    
- Token has **no mathematical relationship** with the original data
    
- Preserves **data type and length** → useful for databases & payment systems
    
- Token has **no value outside the system**
    

---

## **2. Rights Management**

### **Digital Rights Management (DRM)**

- Protects copyrighted digital content (music, movies, e-books)
    
- Content is **encrypted** ⇒ can only be used with a valid decryption key
    

### **Information Rights Management (IRM)**

- Protects organizational documents (emails, reports, files)
    
- Controls:
    
    - who can open
        
    - who can edit
        
    - who can print or forward
        
- Ensures sensitive internal information stays protected after sharing

# **10.1.4 Protecting Data Privacy — Summary**

Organizations handle large amounts of data, but some of it is **sensitive** and must be protected. Sensitive information falls into three categories:

### **• Personal Information**

Example: **An @Apollo employee’s bank details**  
Contains private data that could identify or harm an individual.

### **• Business Information**

Example: **A new eLearning tool @Apollo plans to launch next year**  
This information belongs to the organization and must be protected from competitors.

### **• Classified Information**

Example: **Restricted access government information for a high-security training module**  
This type of information has strict access requirements and must remain confidential.

Protecting data privacy involves controlling access and applying strong safeguards.

---

# **10.1.6 Data Integrity — Summary**

**Integrity** ensures data stays accurate, consistent, and trustworthy throughout its entire lifecycle:  
capture → storage → retrieval → update → transfer.

### **How Data Integrity Is Ensured**

- **Hashing** — verifies that data has not been altered
    
- **Validation checks** — ensures data is entered correctly
    
- **Consistency checks** — ensures stored data matches expected formats or patterns
    
- **Access controls** — restrict who can modify data
    

Loss of integrity can make data useless or dangerous.  
Some sectors (e.g., banking) depend heavily on strong data integrity.

---

# **10.1.7 Availability — Summary**

Availability means that information, systems, and services must be accessible **whenever authorized users need them**.

Typical events that can impact availability include:

- System crashes
    
- Hardware failures
    
- Software bugs
    
- Power outages
    
- Network failures
    
- Cyberattacks (e.g., DoS)
    
- Natural disasters
    
- Misconfigurations
    

Organizations must identify and mitigate these risks to maintain service uptime.

---

# **10.1.8 Ensuring Availability — Summary**

Cybercriminals often target **availability**, especially through DoS attacks, because taking a system offline disrupts business operations.

### **Methods to Maintain High Availability**

- **Redundancy** (duplicate systems/components)
    
- **Regular system backups**
    
- **Resilient architecture**
    
- **Routine hardware maintenance**
    
- **Frequent OS and software patches**
    
- **Disaster recovery plans**
    
- **Fast and organized incident response**
    

These measures help keep services accessible even during failures or attacks.

---

# **10.1.9 Ensuring Availability — Details**

Here are the main strategies organizations use to increase availability:

### **Regular Maintenance**

Keeps systems healthy by replacing components, cleaning, patching, and optimizing equipment.

### **Software and OS Updates**

Fix vulnerabilities and improve reliability. Should follow a scheduled routine.

### **Backups**

Critical for restoring data after corruption or loss.  
Backups must be **tested** regularly.

### **Disaster Recovery Planning**

Defines clear procedures for emergencies.  
Staff must be trained and recovery systems tested.

### **Adopting New Technologies**

High availability requires using modern tools that adapt to evolving cyber threats.

### **Continuous Monitoring**

Real-time log monitoring and alerts allow teams to detect attacks instantly and respond quickly.

### **Testing Systems**

Includes port scans, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests to find weaknesses before attackers do.
