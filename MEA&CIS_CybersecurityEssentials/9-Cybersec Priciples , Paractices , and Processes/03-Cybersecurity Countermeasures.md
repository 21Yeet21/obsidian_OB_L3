# **10.3.2 Hardware-Based and Software-Based Technologies**

Cybersecurity uses **software safeguards** and **hardware safeguards** to protect systems, data, and networks.

---

## **Software-Based Countermeasures**

Installed on individual hosts, servers, or devices.

### **1. Host-Based Firewalls**

- Control remote access to a system
    
- Built into OS (Windows Firewall) or third-party tools
    

### **2. Port Scanners**

- Discover and monitor **open ports** on a host/server
    
- Examples: Nmap, Netcat
    

### **3. Protocol Analyzers (Signature Analyzers)**

- Capture + examine network traffic
    
- Identify misconfigurations
    
- Baseline traffic patterns
    
- Detect abnormal behavior
    
- Examples: Wireshark, tcpdump
    

### **4. Vulnerability Scanners**

- Assess weaknesses on systems/networks
    
- Examples: Nessus, OpenVAS
    

### **5. Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)**

- Monitor activity on a **host only**
    
- Detect unusual behavior, generate logs & alerts
    
- Suitable for servers with sensitive data
    
- Example: OSSEC, Tripwire

## **Hardware-Based Countermeasures**

These protect entire networks or physical locations.

### **1. Hardware Firewalls**

- Block unwanted traffic
    
- Apply rules to inbound/outbound connections
    
- Example: ASA/NGA firewalls
    

### **2. Proxy Servers**

- Act on behalf of clients
    
- Present a single external IP
    
- Hide internal addresses
    
- Add filtering & caching
    

### **3. Biometric Access Devices**

- Fingerprint scanners
    
- Iris scanners
    
- Control physical access to servers and sensitive rooms
    

### **4. Switches**

- Core network connection devices
    
- Can enhance security with:
    
    - Port security
        
    - VLANs
        
    - STP protections
        
    - DHCP snooping
        
    - Dynamic ARP inspection

# **10.3.3 Establishing a Culture of Cybersecurity Awareness**

Technology alone cannot secure an organization.  
Employees must understand risks and follow best practices.

A strong awareness program includes:

- Regular cybersecurity training
    
- Phishing simulations
    
- Clear security procedures
    
- Posters, reminders, and awareness campaigns
    
- Guidance on device usage and password hygiene
    

Employees may unintentionally create security threats if not trained.

---

# **10.3.4 Avatar — Ongoing Awareness**

Security awareness is **not a one-time event**.  
It must be:

- **Continuous**
    
- **Updated regularly** for new threats
    
- **Supported by management**
    
- **Practiced by all staff**
    

A true security culture involves everyone in the organization.

---

# **10.3.5 Policies**

A **security policy** sets rules, expectations, and procedures.

### A good security policy:

- Shows the organization’s commitment to security
    
- Defines acceptable behavior
    
- Ensures consistent operations
    
- Defines consequences for violations
    
- Supports security staff with management approval
    

### Typical sections in a security policy:

- **Access control**  
    Who is allowed to access which resources; authentication requirements.
    
- **Password policy**  
    Minimum length, complexity, expiration deadlines.
    
- **Acceptable use policy (AUP)**  
    What users can/cannot do on company systems.
    
- **Remote access rules**  
    VPN use, authentication, authorized remote actions.
    
- **Update/patch management**  
    Procedures for OS & software updates.
    
- **Incident response plan**  
    Steps for handling security incidents or breaches.
    

The **AUP** is the most common policy.  
It defines permitted and prohibited activities on organizational systems.

---

# **10.3.6 Standards**

Standards ensure **consistency** in network operations and security.

### Standards help IT with:

- Efficient design
    
- Simplified maintenance
    
- Easier troubleshooting
    
- Uniform security enforcement
    

### Example of a Standard → Password Standard

- At least 8 characters
    
- Uppercase + lowercase + number + symbol
    
- New password every 30 days
    
- Store last 12 passwords to prevent reuse
    

Standards support the broader security policies.
