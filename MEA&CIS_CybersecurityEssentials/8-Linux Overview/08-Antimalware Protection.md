# **9.2.1 Endpoint Threats — Summary**

Endpoints are any devices that connect to a network. This includes:

- Computers, laptops, servers
    
- Printers, IP phones
    
- IoT devices (cameras, controllers, light bulbs, appliances)
    
- Remote devices connecting through VPN
    
- Cloud-based systems and services
    

Each endpoint can become an entry point for malware.

### **Why malware remains a major challenge**

- By 2021, a ransomware attack occurs every **11 seconds**.
    
- Global ransomware cost expected to reach **$6 trillion annually**.
    
- **8 million** cryptojacking attempts were recorded in 2018.
    
- Global spam volume increased sharply (8–10% considered malicious).
    
- Average attacks per macOS device expected to rise from **4.8 → 14.2** (2018–2020).
    
- Malware can modify its features within **24 hours** to avoid detection.
    

Endpoints represent one of the **largest attack surfaces** in modern networks.

# **9.2.2 Endpoint Security — Summary**

External attacks often target:

- Web servers
    
- Public-facing services
    
- Networks through DoS/DDoS
    
- Data servers
    

Organizations deploy perimeter defenses such as:

- **VPN routers**
    
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (ASA)**
    
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**
    
- **AAA servers**
    
- **Secure email and web gateways (ESA/WSA)**

### **Internal threats are equally dangerous**

Attacks can come from inside the network when a host is compromised. Two internal elements require protection:

### **1. Endpoints**

Devices such as PCs, laptops, printers, servers, and phones can be infected and used to pivot deeper into the network.

### **2. Network infrastructure**

Devices such as switches, APs, and IP telephony systems can be attacked using:

- MAC table overflow
    
- Spoofing
    
- DHCP attacks
    
- LAN storms
    
- STP manipulation
    
- VLAN hopping
    

**This module focuses on securing endpoints.**

# **9.2.3 Host-Based Malware Protection — Summary**

Endpoints increasingly operate outside the corporate perimeter (home networks, public Wi-Fi, VPNs). Host-based security is essential.

### **Host-based antimalware software**

Installed directly on the device. Examples:

- Windows Defender
    
- Cisco AMP for Endpoints
    
- Norton, McAfee, Trend Micro
    

### **Detection methods**

1. **Signature-based**
    
    - Detects known malware using fingerprinting.
        
2. **Heuristics-based**
    
    - Detects malware families using shared characteristics.
        
3. **Behavior-based**
    
    - Detects suspicious actions (e.g., privilege escalation, unexpected encryption).
        

### **Real-time protection**

Monitors activity as it happens.

### **Agent-based vs Agentless Antivirus**

- **Agent-based** runs on each machine (common on physical PCs).
    
- **Agentless** runs from a central security appliance (ideal for virtual environments to reduce performance overhead). Example: VMware vShield.
    

### **Host-based Firewall**

Restricts inbound/outbound traffic based on local rules.

Examples:

- Windows Defender Firewall
    
- Linux iptables
    
- TCP Wrappers
    

### **Why host-based suites matter**

A complete suite includes:

- Antivirus
    
- Anti-phishing
    
- Safe browsing tools
    
- HIPS (host intrusion prevention)
    
- Firewall
    
- Logging (telemetry)
    

Logs can be sent to a central system for analysis.

### **Recommendation**

Use host-based security on both **home** and **enterprise** devices.

# **9.2.4 Network-Based Malware Protection — Summary**

In modern “borderless networks,” endpoints rely on **network-level** scanning devices for additional protection.

### **Examples of network-based malware prevention tools**

- **Advanced Malware Protection (AMP)**
    
    - Endpoint and cloud-based malware defense.
        
- **Email Security Appliance (ESA)**
    
    - Filters spam, phishing, and malicious attachments.
        
- **Web Security Appliance (WSA)**
    
    - Filters dangerous URLs and enforces acceptable use policies.
        
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**
    
    - Ensures only compliant/authorized devices connect.
        

### **How these tools work together**

- They share intelligence (e.g., Talos Threat Grid).
    
- Sandboxing analyzes suspicious files in a safe environment.
    
- Firewalls and IPS share detection events.
    
- EDR/endpoint sensors provide local visibility.
    

### **Goal**

Create **multiple layers of protection** beyond what a single endpoint can provide.
