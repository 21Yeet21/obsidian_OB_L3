# **7.1.4 Operating System Vulnerabilities — Summary**

Operating systems contain millions of lines of code, which means **vulnerabilities are inevitable**. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access, change permissions, or steal data.

Windows requires proper configuration to reduce risk.

### **Key Security Recommendations**

### **1. Malware Protection**

- Windows Defender enabled by default
    
- Disabling it increases exposure to viruses and malware
    

### **2. Background Services**

- Windows runs many hidden services
    
- Unknown or suspicious services can become attack points
    

### **3. Data Encryption**

- Unencrypted data can be intercepted
    
- Critical for laptops and mobile devices
    

### **4. Security Policy**

- Configure Windows Security Policies
    
- Controls login rules, account policies, and restrictions
    

### **5. Windows Firewall**

- Built-in firewall limits network communication
    
- Rule cleanup is essential (remove unused open ports)
    

### **6. File & Folder Permissions**

- Apply **least privilege**
    
- Avoid giving “Everyone” Full Control
    
- Assign permissions properly to users/groups
    

### **7. Strong Passwords**

- Weak or missing passwords expose systems
    
- Admin accounts require especially strong passwords
    

### **8. User Account Control**

- Avoid using an Administrator account for daily tasks
    
- Log in as Standard User and elevate privileges only when needed
