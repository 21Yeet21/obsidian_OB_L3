- Strong security and strict access controls are essential to protect systems, applications, and data.
    

---

## **1.1.11 Private Cloud Threats**

- Private cloud includes all servers and IT resources accessible internally via the Internet.
    
- Typical threats:
    
    - Unauthorized network scanning or port scanning
