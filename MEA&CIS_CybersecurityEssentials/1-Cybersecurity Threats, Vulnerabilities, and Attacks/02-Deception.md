## **1.2.1 Social Engineering**

- **Definition:**  
    Social engineering is a **non-technical strategy** used to manipulate people into revealing confidential information or performing certain actions.
    
- Instead of exploiting system or software flaws, it **targets human nature**, using:
    
    - Curiosity
        
    - Greed
        
    - Fear
        
    - Willingness to help
        

**Example:**  
An attacker pretends to be a bank employee and asks for a user’s credentials to “verify identity.”

## **1.2.2 Social Engineering Tactics**

Cybercriminals use several psychological tactics to manipulate their targets.

### **Authority**

People are more likely to obey instructions from someone who appears to be in charge.  
_Example:_ An executive opens an attachment that looks like a legal document but is actually malware.

### **Intimidation**

Attackers pressure or bully victims into acting.  
_Example:_ A caller pretends to be a boss and threatens an employee to send corrupted files urgently.

### **Consensus (Social Proof)**

People follow what others seem to be doing.  
_Example:_ Fake “business opportunity” posts with fake positive comments convince victims to invest.

### **Scarcity**

People act quickly when they think something is limited.  
_Example:_ An email claims only a few luxury items remain at a low price.

### **Urgency**

People rush when they think time is running out.  
_Example:_ A fake limited-time shipping offer pushes victims to click malicious links.

### **Familiarity / Liking**

Victims are more likely to trust someone they know or like.  
_Example:_ Attackers clone a friend’s social media profile to gain trust.

### **Trust**

Attackers build relationships to gain access.  
_Example:_ A fake “security expert” calls to help fix an issue and instead installs malware.

## **1.2.3 Awareness**

- Cybercriminals often **combine multiple tactics** for higher success.
    
- **Cybersecurity professionals** must educate users and raise awareness to prevent these attacks.

## **1.2.4 Watch Out!**

**Scenario:**  
An email pretends to be from “Guru,” asking employees to download a VPN for secure Wi-Fi.  
Clicking the link installs malware.

**Answer:** 🟩 **Pretexting**

---

## **1.2.6 Shoulder Surfing and Dumpster Diving**

### **Shoulder Surfing**

- Observing victims’ private information (PINs, passwords, etc.) directly or using cameras/binoculars.
    
- Example: Watching someone enter their ATM PIN.
    
- **Countermeasure:** ATM screens are angled to prevent visibility.
    

### **Dumpster Diving**

- Searching through trash for valuable data (documents, credentials, etc.).
    
- **Countermeasure:** Shred or burn sensitive papers after a set period.
    

---

## **1.2.7 Impersonation and Hoaxes**

- Attackers **pretend to be trusted individuals** or create **false alerts** to trick victims.
    
- Example: Fake IT staff or security warnings to collect credentials.
    

---

## **1.2.8 Piggybacking and Tailgating**

- **Definition:** A criminal follows an authorized person into a restricted area.
    
- **Methods:**
    
    - Pretending to be escorted
        
    - Blending into a crowd
        
    - Taking advantage of careless employees
        

**Prevention:**  
Use **mantraps** (two-door entry systems) where one door must close before another opens.

---

## **1.2.9 Other Methods of Deception**

### **Fake Invoices**

- Fraudulent invoices or login screens trick victims into paying or giving credentials.
    

### **Watering Hole Attacks**

- Attackers infect legitimate websites frequently visited by a target organization.
    

### **Typosquatting**

- Fake domains similar to legitimate ones collect users’ personal or financial data.  
    _Example:_ `app0lo.com` instead of `apollo.com`
    

### **Email Spoofing**

- Removing or hiding “external sender” tags to appear internal and trustworthy.
    

### **Influence Campaigns**

- Coordinated disinformation efforts using fake news and social media to manipulate public opinion.

- Avoid automatic downloads.
    
- Follow established security policies.
    
- Encourage responsibility for security awareness.
    
- Never give in to pressure or intimidation tactics.
