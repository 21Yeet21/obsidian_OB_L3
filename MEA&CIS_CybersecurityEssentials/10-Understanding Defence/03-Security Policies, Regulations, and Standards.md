# **11.3.3 BYOD Policies**

**BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** policies define how employees can use their personal devices (phones, tablets, laptops) to access organizational resources.

A good BYOD policy includes:

- **Security requirements** (PINs, biometrics, encryption)
    
- **Allowed / prohibited apps**
    
- **Mandatory mobile antivirus and updates**
    
- **Remote wipe** capabilities if the device is lost or stolen
    
- **Network access rules** (VPN, segmentation, NAC)
    
- **Privacy rules** (what the company can/cannot monitor)
    

The goal is to reduce risks introduced by personal devices while still allowing employees flexibility and productivity.

# **11.3.4 Regulatory and Standards Compliance**

Organizations must comply with **external laws, regulations, and industry standards** related to information security.

Key points:

- Security professionals must understand laws, codes of ethics, and compliance frameworks.
    
- Many industries require **mandatory security policies** and audits.
    
- Regulations define **responsibilities**, required protections, and **liabilities** for failures.
    
- The applicable regulations depend on the type of data handled (health, finance, education, government, etc.).
    
- Examples (covered later in the course): GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX, ISO/IEC 27001.
    

Compliance ensures:

- Legal protection
    
- Proper handling of sensitive data
    
- Accountability and transparency
