Good operational management is critical for keeping systems secure.  
@Apollo must understand key processes, starting with **configuration management**.

# **11.2.2 Configuration Management**

Configuration management = **identifying, controlling, and auditing** all changes to a system’s baseline.

**Baseline configuration** =  
A documented template that defines required settings, apps, and security controls for a system.

Example:  
When deploying Windows PCs, administrators install required software and configure security settings → this becomes the organization’s Windows baseline.

Configuration management prevents:

- Unauthorized changes
    
- Misconfigurations
    
- Inconsistent system setups

# **11.2.3 Log Files**

A **log** records events as they happen. Each entry contains details about a specific event.

Examples:

- **Audit log** → user authentication attempts
    
- **Access log** → requests for files or resources
    

Logs help analysts:

- Reconstruct attacks
    
- Identify successful defenses
    
- Detect anomalies
    

Organizations need a **log management process** for:

1. **Generating** logs
    
2. **Transmitting** logs
    
3. **Storing** logs
    
4. **Analyzing** log data
    
5. **Disposing** of old logs

# **11.2.4 Operating System Logs vs Application Security Logs**

### **Operating System Logs**

Record OS-related events, such as:

- Successful/failed logins
    
- System errors
    
- Service activity
    
- Resource usage
    

Useful for understanding system behavior and early signs of misuse.

### **Application Security Logs**

Generated by:

- Security tools (IDS, IPS, antivirus)
    
- Network and endpoint security software
    

These logs help detect:

- Malware activity
    
- Attacks and suspicious events
    
- Long-term trends
    
- Compliance requirements

# **11.2.5 Protocol Analyzers**

![[Pasted image 20251122120752.png]]

Also called **packet sniffers**.

They **capture and analyze network traffic** in real time.

What they do:

- Traffic logging
    
- Detect network misuse
    
- Identify intrusions
    
- Analyze performance issues
    
- Isolate compromised hosts
    

Used for:

- Security investigations
    
- Network troubleshooting
    
- Forensics
    

Popular tools include:  
**Wireshark, tcpdump, Tshark, Omnipeek**, etc.

# **11.2.6 Avatar**

@Apollo found two unknown log files and needs your help identifying them — this is your next task.

If you want, I can help you **identify sample logs**, or you can upload them and I’ll classify them.
