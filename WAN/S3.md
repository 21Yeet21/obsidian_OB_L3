## 🌐 WAN Technologies – Lesson Summary

### 1️⃣ Layer 1 (Physical Layer) Concepts

#### 🔹 Key Elements

- **Modulation (e.g., ADSL)**:  
    Converts digital signals into analog forms for transmission over physical media (like telephone lines).
    
- **Multiplexing (MUX)**:  
    Technique to send multiple transmissions over a single physical medium.
    
    - **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)**: Shares the link by **time slots**.
        
        - Example: Multiple users send data one after another rapidly.
            
    - **Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)**: Shares the link by **frequency ranges**.
        
        - Example: Used in **radio** and **TV broadcasting**.
            

#### 🔹 DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing)

- Similar concept to FDM but uses **different wavelengths of light** through fiber optic cables.
    
- Allows **many optical signals** to travel simultaneously over one fiber.
    
- Can be compared to **time multiplexing**, as both increase link efficiency by sharing one medium.

### 2️⃣ Legacy WAN Technologies

#### 🔹 Frame Relay (Relais de Trame)

- Uses **virtual circuits** (PVC or SVC) instead of dedicated physical circuits.
    
- Was cheaper than older leased-line technologies.
    
- Still packet-switched, suitable for connecting multiple sites efficiently.
    

#### 🔹 ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)

- Based on **asynchronous transfer** using **fixed-size cells** (53 bytes).
    
- Differentiates between **types of services** (voice, video, data).
    
- Sends cells **continuously**, even if no data is available — helps maintain synchronization.
    
- Uses **two parallel buses** and guarantees timing precision, making it suitable for real-time traffic.

### 3️⃣ Modern WAN Connectivity Options

|Type|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Dedicated WAN**|Private, high-performance connection between sites|Leased lines, Broadband|
|**Switched WAN**|Uses a shared network with logical circuits|Frame Relay, MPLS|
|**Internet-based WAN**|Uses the public Internet for connectivity|Broadband VPN, SD-WAN|
|**Access Types**|Can be **wired** (Fiber, Copper) or **wireless** (4G, 5G, Satellite)|–|

### 4️⃣ WAN Ethernet

- Modern enterprises now adopt **Ethernet-based WAN** solutions for simplicity and scalability.
    
- Examples used by **Tunisie Télécom**:
    
    - **Metro Ethernet (Metro-E)**: High-speed Ethernet across a metropolitan area.
        
    - **EoMPLS (Ethernet over MPLS)**: Encapsulates Ethernet frames inside MPLS for transport over a service provider backbone.
