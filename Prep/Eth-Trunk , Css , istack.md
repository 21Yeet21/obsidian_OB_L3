### 🔹 iStack (Empilement)

#### Definition

- **iStack** (stacking) = technology that allows **multiple switches** to be combined into **one logical switch**.
    
- They are linked with **high-bandwidth stacking cables**.
    
    - Example: Two switches iStacked with 40 Gbps stacking cables → they operate as **one device**.
        

#### Advantages

- **High throughput** between switches (no bottleneck like normal uplinks).
    
- **Simplified management**: only **one IP address** is needed to manage the whole stack.
    
- **Redundancy**: if one switch fails, others continue to work.
    

#### Example

- Switch1 + Switch2 connected by iStack → act as a **single big switch**.
    
- If you connect a server to Switch1 and another server to Switch2, they are in the **same logical switch** → no need for STP (Spanning Tree) between them.

### 🔹 Server Types (Form Factors)

- **Rack Server**:
    
    - Flat, fits in a rack (standard 1U/2U sizes).
        
    - Example: Used in data centers, easy to stack vertically.
        
- **Tower Server**:
    
    - Looks like a desktop PC (tower case).
        
    - Example: Used in small businesses or offices.
        
- **Blade Server (Lame)**:
    
    - Slim modules that slide into a **blade enclosure** (chassis).
        
    - Example: Used in large data centers for high density + shared power/cooling.
